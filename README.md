# SuperStoreOrders-Data-Analytics-using-python

I'll be performing a 10days Data Analytics Challenge on a Super Store Orders Database of over 50,000 data to find insights, trends, patterns and come up with business decisions.
I will be using python and Tableau for this project.
Today, I will be defining the project objectives

1. Which product has the highest number of sales and in which country and region?

2. Which product has the highest number of customer demands, in what country and region?

3. Which product or products produced the highest profit?
4. How does the shipping cost and method affect the sales of products

Join me as I take you through the process and allow me show you how business decisions are made with Data Analytics.

The dataset contains the following key variables;
order_id, order_date, ship_date, ship_mode, customer_name, segment, state, country, market, region, product_id, category,  sub_category,
product_name, sales, quantity, discount, profit, shipping_cost, order_priority, year.
